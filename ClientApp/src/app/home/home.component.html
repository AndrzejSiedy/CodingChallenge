        <p>
            Create a simple web front end that displays a list of items to the user. The user should be able to
            create a new item and update an existing one. The front end should ensure only valid input data is
            accepted. The priorities for the front end are that it’s fast and snappy. Any delays in loading data, or
            exceptions raised along the way are handled appropriately to give the user a good experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Create a simple API for the front end to communicate with. The API should handle requests and
            provide appropriate responses over a REST interface. It’s not necessary to incorporate a database for
            storing data, for this exercise you can just mock a database within the API (feel free to comment on
            any strategies you would employ in production). You should ensure that the data includes sensitive
            fields, and furthermore ensure these are not displayed on the front end, so you’ll have to include a
            strategy for dealing with that… a password field in a User, a cost-price field in a Product, etc.
            The API should ensure the data it puts into the database is correct and won’t cause problems within
            the system. Bear this in mind when creating your solution.

            We’re looking to see how you approach:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Performance – Can you identify any bottlenecks or areas of concern relating to
                    performance? What have (or could) you have implemented to address those?

                </li>
                <li>
                    Security - Not so much things like SSL and Auth although you can discuss these, but more
                    along the lines of protecting the system from the user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Design – Code layout, architecture choices, data structures, coding style, readability,
                    efficiency, extensibility, knowledge of language, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Error Handling – How you handle failures/errors/exceptions of varying severity,
                    logging/reporting strategy, appropriate courses of following actions, etc. Perhaps generate
                    errors or problem situations to demonstrate solutions. We’re not expecting a solution where
                    every possible error is handled, we’re more looking to see how you go about handling errors
                    and problem situations.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            It’s ok to stub out bits of code, leave comments and discuss how you would do things which can’t be
            implemented in a reasonable time. We’re not expecting a fully implemented and working end to end
            solution, we’re more interested in the thought process you go through, how you approach the
            problem, attention to detail, technical choices, etc.
